This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Environment variables

- Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and set `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` to your browser API key so the investments map renders.
- When deploying via GitHub Actions/Pages or another host, surface the same variable as an environment secret so the build can inline it for the client bundle.
